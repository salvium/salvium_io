excerpt: "Important update on our recent audit completion and current supply status of Salvium."
---

We're pleased to announce the successful completion of Salvium's comprehensive supply audit. This audit became necessary after a security incident allowed unauthorized coin minting. For detailed information, please visit: [Salvium Knowledge Base - Supply Audit](https://salvium.io/salvium-knowledge-base/salvium-supply-audit/).

The audit has been thorough and extensive. We deeply appreciate the community's support throughout this process. With the audit now finalized, we can fully redirect our focus to Salvium One development, accelerating the project into its next phase.

### Audit Results and Emission Impact

As anticipated, the audit confirmed that unauthorized coins were sold via exchanges. This resulted in approximately 9,459,087 SAL entering circulation ahead of schedule. These coins are now held by innocent purchasers who acquired them without knowledge of their origin.

Most importantly, we have verified that the unauthorized actor no longer possesses any valid coins from the incident. While they attempted to pass 382,600 coins through the audit, these were successfully blacklisted in a hard fork before the funds could be unlocked.

The premature circulation of these coins will not affect the initial maximum supply of 184.4 million SAL. Rather, it has accelerated our emission schedule, meaning the network will reach the planned total emission sooner than originally anticipated. For this reason, "inflation" is not precisely accurateâ€”this represents an acceleration of planned emission rather than an increase to the total supply.

### Detailed Supply Breakdown (height 179201)

| Description | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| Total in mining block rewards | 42,501,726 |
| Total in staking rewards (including burnt) | 5,100,431 |
| Total supply | 47,602,157 |
| Total audited | 47,043,844 |
| Total blacklisted | 382,600 |
| Total SAL1 issued through audit | 46,661,244 |
| Un-audited Treasury SAL | 10,400,000 |
| Accelerated emission (SAL1 issued + treasury - supply) | 9,459,087 |

### Governance Fund

The 10.4 million SAL from the governance vault that couldn't be audited (due to being locked) remain in SAL, which is no longer usable. Upon the launch of Salvium One (anticipated in Q2 2025), we plan to implement a consensus-based mechanism to access these coins. Details of this mechanism will be provided at a later date.

The new SAL1 will continue to follow the locking schedule as defined in the lite paper. With the primary audit complete, we can confidently move forward with preparing a detailed treasury report. Despite the temporary inaccessibility of the locked 10.4 million SAL, the project maintains sufficient unlocked funds to fully implement all planned initiatives.

### Mitigation Strategy

The community has explored various strategies to address the accelerated emission, including burning a portion of the governance vault funds. However, given market volatility and uncertainty, it would be imprudent to burn governance funds at this stage, as we cannot precisely predict the capital required for the project's path to self-sustainability.

It's worth noting that due to this accelerated emission event, the pre-mine now represents a smaller percentage of the overall circulating supply. All relevant documentation will be updated to reflect these changes.

We sincerely appreciate the community's patience and continued trust as we implement these critical improvements to secure Salvium's long-term integrity and sustainability.
