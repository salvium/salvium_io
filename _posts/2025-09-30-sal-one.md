## We Did It - Privacy and Compliance United

After 15 months of relentless development, countless late nights, and unwavering community support, we're thrilled to announce that Salvium One launches in a hard fork on **October 13th, 2025**. This isn't just an upgrade - this is the realization of our vision: a privacy coin that exchanges can actually list.

To our incredible dev team who solved what everyone said was impossible, to our community who believed when others doubted, and to everyone who contributed code, ideas, and support - **THANK YOU**. You've made history.

## What We've Built Together

On October 13th, Salvium One goes live with the world's first implementation of:

**SPARC Protocol**: Our anonymous return mechanism that lets exchanges comply with regulations while users maintain complete privacy. No other privacy coin has this.

**T-CLSAG Signatures**: Our custom ring signature adaptation making all of this possible.

## This Changes Everything

Remember when privacy coins started getting delisted? When everyone said you had to choose between privacy and exchange access?

**That era ends October 13th.**

Salvium One proves that privacy is not incompatible with regulation - it just needed better cryptography. Our Cypher Stack audits confirm it: the math works, the privacy holds, and exchanges can finally list us without fear.

Privacy isn't dying. It's evolving. And you're part of that evolution.
