<h2 id="understanding-preprints-and-why-they-matter">Understanding Preprints and Why They Matter</h2>

<p>Before diving into the technical details, it’s important to understand what a preprint represents in the world of cryptographic research. A preprint is an academic paper that has been prepared for peer review but has not yet undergone formal publication. In the cryptocurrency and cryptography fields, preprints serve several critical functions:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Transparency</strong> – They allow the community to examine proposed protocols before implementation</li>
  <li><strong>Peer Review</strong> – They enable expert cryptographers to identify potential vulnerabilities or improvements</li>
  <li><strong>Academic Rigor</strong> – They demonstrate commitment to following established scientific protocols</li>
  <li><strong>Security Validation</strong> – Independent audits verify that mathematical claims hold under scrutiny</li>
</ol>

<p>For a privacy-focused protocol like Salvium, submitting our work for independent audit by specialists like Cypher Stack is not just best practice — it’s essential. Cypher Stack brings extensive expertise in Monero security and cryptographic research, making them the ideal choice to validate our innovations.</p>

<h2 id="the-technical-innovation-t-clsag-explained">The Technical Innovation: T-CLSAG Explained</h2>

<h3 id="what-is-clsag">What is CLSAG?</h3>

<p>CLSAG (Concise Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signatures) is the current signature scheme used by Monero to provide privacy and prevent double-spending. Traditional CLSAG allows a user to prove they know one secret key \(x\) corresponding to a public key \(K = xG\), where \(G\) is a standard elliptic-curve generator.</p>

<h3 id="the-carrot-addressing-challenge">The Carrot Addressing Challenge</h3>

<p>The proposed Carrot addressing scheme introduces a more sophisticated public-key format:</p>

<p>\[
K_o = xG + yT
\]</p>

<p>where \(G\) and \(T\) are two distinct elliptic-curve generators. This dual-generator approach enables powerful new features like forward secrecy and enhanced privacy protections. However, it also presents a significant cryptographic challenge: how do you prove knowledge of both secrets \(x\) and \(y\) while maintaining all the privacy and efficiency guarantees of the original CLSAG scheme?</p>

<h3 id="our-solution-t-clsag">Our Solution: T-CLSAG</h3>

<p>Our T-CLSAG scheme solves this challenge elegantly by:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Extending the Challenge Chain</strong> – We modify CLSAG’s iterative challenge computation to account for both scalar secrets</li>
  <li><strong>Preserving Key Images</strong> – We maintain the traditional key-image structure \(L = x \cdot H_p(K_o)\), ensuring backward compatibility</li>
  <li><strong>Aggregate Proof Structure</strong> – We use cryptographic aggregation to prove knowledge of both secrets efficiently</li>
  <li><strong>Domain Separation</strong> – We employ careful domain separators to prevent cryptographic mixing between different contexts</li>
</ol>

<p>The mathematical elegance lies in how we extend the existing proof system without compromising any of its security properties. The signature remains concise, the anonymity set is preserved, and double-spend protection functions exactly as before.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-represents-a-major-milestone">Why This Represents a Major Milestone</h2>

<h3 id="development-completion">Development Completion</h3>

<p>The submission of this preprint represents the culmination of extensive development work. The bulk of our implementation is complete — we’re not starting from scratch or proposing theoretical concepts. Instead, we’re validating the mathematical foundations of a working system. This puts us in an enviable position where the cryptographic audit is the primary remaining step before deployment.</p>

<h3 id="collaborative-achievement">Collaborative Achievement</h3>

<p>This work has been in collaboration with Cypher Stack’s cryptographers. Their expertise in Monero’s cryptographic foundations has been invaluable in refining our approach. We want to express our sincere gratitude for their ongoing support and partnership in advancing the state of privacy-preserving blockchain technology.</p>

<h3 id="industry-leadership">Industry Leadership</h3>

<p>While the broader Monero ecosystem continues to explore advanced addressing schemes and signature protocols, Salvium is taking the lead in practical implementation. Our T-CLSAG scheme represents original research that advances the entire field of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h2 id="how-this-advances-salviums-mission">How This Advances Salvium’s Mission</h2>

<p>Salvium’s core mission centers on creating a privacy-first blockchain that can comply with emerging regulatory frameworks while maintaining the strong privacy guarantees that users expect. T-CLSAG and Carrot addressing are crucial components of this vision:</p>

<h3 id="regulatory-compliance">Regulatory Compliance</h3>

<p>The enhanced cryptographic flexibility provided by dual-secret proofs enables features like selective transparency and compliance-friendly privacy. Users can maintain strong privacy by default while having the option to provide specific disclosures when required by regulation.</p>

<h3 id="forward-secrecy">Forward Secrecy</h3>

<p>T-CLSAG enables forward-secrecy properties that protect user privacy even against future cryptographic advances, including potential quantum-computing threats. This future-proofing is essential for a long-term privacy strategy.</p>

<h3 id="defi-integration">DeFi Integration</h3>

<p>The advanced cryptographic capabilities unlocked by T-CLSAG provide the foundation for sophisticated DeFi applications that maintain privacy. This aligns with Salvium’s goal of becoming the leading platform for private decentralized finance.</p>

<h2 id="the-broader-context-moneros-development">The Broader Context: Monero’s Development</h2>

<p>It’s worth acknowledging the broader ecosystem context. The Monero project has been instrumental in supporting research into advanced addressing schemes and signature protocols. Projects like FCMP++ (Full-Chain Membership Proofs) and various addressing proposals have created a rich research environment.</p>

<p>Salvium’s approach differs in crucial ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Implementation Focus</strong> – While much of the ecosystem work remains theoretical, Salvium is implementing practical solutions</li>
  <li><strong>Regulatory Awareness</strong> – Our development is guided by real-world regulatory requirements</li>
  <li><strong>DeFi Integration</strong> – We’re building specifically for decentralized finance applications</li>
  <li><strong>Innovation Speed</strong> – Our focused approach allows us to move quickly from research to implementation</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-comes-next">What Comes Next</h2>

<p>The Cypher Stack audit will thoroughly examine our mathematical proofs, implementation considerations, and security claims. This process typically involves:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Mathematical Verification</strong> – Confirming that our proofs are sound and complete</li>
  <li><strong>Security Analysis</strong> – Identifying potential attack vectors or vulnerabilities</li>
  <li><strong>Implementation Review</strong> – Ensuring that the theoretical scheme can be securely implemented</li>
  <li><strong>Performance Evaluation</strong> – Assessing computational and storage requirements</li>
</ol>

<p>Upon successful completion of the audit, we’ll be ready to integrate T-CLSAG into Salvium’s mainnet, representing a significant advancement in blockchain privacy technology.</p>

<h2 id="technical-deep-dive-key-innovations">Technical Deep Dive: Key Innovations</h2>

<h3 id="aggregate-public-keys">Aggregate Public Keys</h3>

<p>We define aggregate public keys that combine multiple inputs:</p>

<p>\[
W_i = \sum H_n(T_j, R, L_1, \ldots, L_m)\, K_{i,j}
\]</p>

<p>This aggregation allows us to prove knowledge of secrets across multiple inputs efficiently while maintaining the ring-signature’s anonymity properties.</p>

<h3 id="challenge-chain-extension">Challenge Chain Extension</h3>

<p>The iterative challenge computation becomes:</p>

<p>\[
c_{i+1} = H_n\bigl(
  T_c, R, m,\,
  [r_{x,i}G + r_{y,i}T + c_i W_i],\,
  [r_{x,i} H_p(K_i) + c_i \widetilde{W}]
\bigr)
\]</p>

<p>This extension ensures that both scalar secrets must be known to complete the proof, while the challenge chain maintains its essential security properties.</p>

<h3 id="backward-compatibility">Backward Compatibility</h3>

<p>Crucially, our key-image computation remains:</p>

<p>\[
L_j = x_j \cdot H_p\bigl(K_{\pi,j}\bigr)
\]</p>

<p>This ensures that existing double-spend detection mechanisms continue to function without modification.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The submission of our T-CLSAG preprint for cryptographic audit represents more than a technical milestone — it demonstrates Salvium’s commitment to rigorous security standards and innovative privacy technology. By extending proven cryptographic techniques to support advanced addressing schemes, we’re building the foundation for the next generation of privacy-preserving blockchain applications.</p>

<p>As we await the results of the Cypher Stack audit, we remain committed to transparency, security, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in private blockchain technology. The future of decentralized finance is private, compliant, and built on solid mathematical foundations.</p>

<p>We’ll continue to update the community as the audit progresses and look forward to sharing the validated T-CLSAG implementation in the near future.</p>

While it wasn’t an official AMA, the transparency and detail provided felt like one. We’ve distilled the highlights into a Q&amp;A format to give the community a clearer picture of where Salvium is headed—from foundational layers to the game-changing vision of Salvium Two.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: Can you walk us through the long-term vision for Salvium?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>A:</strong> Salvium started with a 2-year roadmap, split into three key stages:</p>

  <p>– <strong>Salvium Zero</strong> was our proof-of-concept. It introduced protocol-level asynchronous transactions, handling of transactional imbalances, return payments, and staking mechanics.</p>

  <p>– <strong>Salvium One</strong> focuses on delivering privacy with regulatory compliance. With frameworks like MiCA pushing privacy coins off exchanges, we saw a chance to differentiate by building compliant privacy into the protocol itself.</p>

  <p>– <strong>Salvium Two</strong> is where the real scalability happens. It’s intended as a full smart-contract platform—possibly DAG-based or something similar—focused on transaction throughput without being constrained by 2-minute block times. This layer-2 system shifts reconciliation back to layer-1, but rewards layer-1 validators with a cut of layer-2 gas fees.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: What makes Salvium Two different from other smart-contract platforms?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>A:</strong> Salvium Two will be designed as a transaction-oriented layer, rather than a block-oriented one. We’re not married to any one structure—DAG is a strong candidate—but the guiding principle is to eliminate block overhead and unlock scalability. We believe this model, when paired with our compliant privacy base, can be incredibly disruptive to both crypto and DeFi.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: How confident are you about reaching those goals within the two-year timeframe?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>A:</strong> We’ve funded the project so that even if anything happens to individual team members, the treasury will continue supporting ongoing development. That was built into the original 2-year plan. We’re not at the finish line yet, but we’re on track and as committed as ever. I’m still up at night researching quantum-secure proofs and building out the architectural design for Salvium Two. It’s that exciting.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: How are you handling the potential delay with FCMP++?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>A:</strong> That’s been one of the bigger uncertainties. With the recent delays, we’re now evaluating whether to build a full chain-membership proof scheme in-house. That wasn’t part of the original plan, but we’ve already started liaising with cryptographers to explore it. We’re staying flexible and ready to pivot if needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: What does the development team structure look like right now?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>A:</strong> It’s far from a one-person show. Devs like Akil have been making more commits than I have lately. We also have strong support from our partners at Cypher Stack. As we get closer to launch, you’ll see more of the broader team—including Community Managers, Marketing, and other support roles—stepping into the spotlight.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: What should the crypto world expect from Salvium One’s launch?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>A:</strong> When Salvium One launches, it’s going to send a clear message: privacy can coexist with compliance. That’s not just a tagline—it’s a reality we’re building. And Salvium is leading that charge.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: And what about Salvium Two? Any hints?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>A:</strong> Honestly, people have no idea what’s coming. Salvium Two will be a massively disruptive force across the entire crypto and DeFi ecosystem. We’re aiming to fundamentally reshape how people think about transaction processing and scalability.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-salvium-one"><strong>What is Salvium One?</strong></h2>

<p>Salvium One is the next major version of the Salvium network. It blends our existing privacy features (inherited from CryptoNote) with two new building-blocks:</p>

<p><strong>Carrot addressing scheme:</strong> An improved stealth address scheme that uses two independent “base points”. Carrot adds new privacy and usability features, whilst remaining backwards compatible. It also makes it harder for attackers to break, and prepares us for future upgrades. An updated version of the CLSAG signature scheme — <strong>T-CLSAG</strong>— has been developed in-house, and is also included. <a href="https://docs.salvium.io/THE%20PROJECT/carrot/">Learn more</a></p>

<p><strong>SPARC proof suite:</strong> A family of cryptographic proofs that lets a sender prove control of an output without revealing any private-key information.<br />

Today, we’ll examine our technical solution—how Salvium One addresses these challenges through innovative cryptographic approaches that maintain privacy while enabling regulatory compliance.</p>

<h2 id="the-core-innovation-sparc"><strong>The Core Innovation: SPARC</strong></h2>

<p>At the heart of Salvium One lies SPARC (Spend Proof and Anonymized Returns for CARROT), our extension of the Carrot protocol that enables two critical capabilities:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Anonymized returns</strong>: A privacy-preserving mechanism for two-way transactions</li>
  <li><strong>Spend authority proofs</strong>: A method to verify control over receiving addresses without revealing private keys</li>
</ol>

<p>To understand how SPARC works and why it matters, let’s first explore its foundation—the CARROT protocol—and then examine how SPARC extends it to solve our specific challenges.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-carrot"><strong>Understanding CARROT</strong></h2>

<p>CARROT (Cryptonote Address on Rerandomizable-RingCT-Output Transactions) is a proposed addressing protocol originally designed for Monero. While not yet implemented in Monero, it provides several key capabilities that Salvium leverages:</p>

<h3 id="enhanced-privacy-with-practical-features"><strong>Enhanced Privacy with Practical Features</strong></h3>

<p>CARROT improves on traditional CryptoNote addressing by enabling:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Full view-only wallets</strong>: Unlike traditional Monero view-only wallets that can only see incoming transactions, CARROT allows monitoring of both incoming and outgoing transactions without compromising security</li>
  <li><strong>Enhanced security</strong>: Protection against attacks like the Janus Attack (which can link multiple addresses to the same owner) and the Burning Bug (where users can inadvertently lose funds)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="advanced-wallet-architecture"><strong>Advanced Wallet Architecture</strong></h3>

<p>CARROT introduces a more sophisticated key hierarchy that provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>View-balance key</strong>: A private key that can view all balance information without the ability to spend</li>
  <li><strong>Find-received key</strong>: A capability to identify incoming transactions</li>
  <li><strong>Generate-address key</strong>: The ability to create new addresses without full wallet access</li>
</ul>

<p>This tiered approach allows different levels of wallet access for different purposes—a critical feature for compliance without compromising security.</p>

<h2 id="how-sparc-extends-carrot"><strong>How SPARC Extends CARROT</strong></h2>

<p>While CARROT provides an excellent foundation, it doesn’t address all the requirements for MiCA compliance. This is where SPARC comes in, adding two critical capabilities:</p>

<h3 id="1-anonymized-returns-solving-the-one-way-problem"><strong>1. Anonymized Returns: Solving the One-Way Problem</strong></h3>

<p>Privacy coins typically excel at sending funds anonymously but lack effective mechanisms for returns. SPARC implements a secure return payment system:</p>

<p><strong>How It Works (Simplified):</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>When Alice sends funds to Bob, she includes encrypted return data in the transaction</li>
  <li>Only Bob can identify this as genuine return data; to everyone else, it appears as random noise</li>
  <li>If Bob needs to return funds, he can send them back to Alice without knowing her address</li>
  <li>Alice can verify the returned funds are genuinely for her</li>
</ol>

<p>This system preserves privacy while enabling practical applications like refunds, escrow systems, and two-way payment channels—all essential for everyday commerce.</p>

<h3 id="2-spend-authority-proof-enabling-compliance"><strong>2. Spend Authority Proof: Enabling Compliance</strong></h3>

<p>The spend authority proof is SPARC’s most innovative feature for regulatory compliance. It allows a user to prove they control an address without revealing private keys:</p>

<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>A user creates a zero-knowledge proof showing they have the secret values used to create a one-time output address</li>
  <li>This proof demonstrates address control without revealing any private information</li>
  <li>The proof satisfies standard zero-knowledge properties: completeness, soundness, and zero-knowledge</li>
</ol>

<p>This capability is crucial for MiCA compliance, as it allows exchanges and other regulated entities to verify address ownership without compromising user privacy.</p>

<h2 id="security-guarantees"><strong>Security Guarantees</strong></h2>

<p>SPARC doesn’t just implement these features—it provides formal security guarantees:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Indistinguishability</strong>: Observers cannot tell if a transaction includes return data</li>
  <li><strong>Unlinkability</strong>: Transactions cannot be linked across the blockchain</li>
  <li><strong>Return Address Hiding</strong>: Third parties cannot recover return addresses</li>
  <li><strong>Non-Swindling</strong>: Adversaries cannot hijack return data to redirect funds</li>
  <li><strong>Unforgeability</strong>: Spend proofs cannot be faked without breaking cryptographic assumptions</li>
</ul>

<p>These guarantees ensure that compliance features don’t compromise Salvium’s core privacy protections.</p>

<h2 id="practical-applications"><strong>Practical Applications</strong></h2>

<p>The combination of CARROT and SPARC enables numerous real-world applications that were previously difficult or impossible with privacy coins:</p>

<h3 id="e-commerce-and-refunds"><strong>E-commerce and Refunds</strong></h3>

<p>Merchants can issue refunds without storing customer wallet addresses, enabling private yet functional e-commerce experiences.</p>

<h3 id="compliant-exchange-listings"><strong>Compliant Exchange Listings</strong></h3>

<p>By allowing exchanges to verify transaction information when required by regulations without compromising the privacy of the entire system, Salvium can potentially remain listed on centralized exchanges even under MiCA.</p>

<h3 id="escrow-systems"><strong>Escrow Systems</strong></h3>

<p>Funds can be returned automatically if conditions aren’t met, enabling trustless escrow arrangements that preserve privacy.</p>

<h3 id="private-smart-contracts"><strong>Private Smart Contracts</strong></h3>

<p>The foundation for complex, private return logic that can be built into applications—laying groundwork for Salvium Two.</p>

<h2 id="technical-quality"><strong>Technical Quality</strong></h2>

<p>Independent security researchers have reviewed SPARC and found it to be “an impressive protocol that is correct, fitting for its intended purpose, and will benefit users.” The protocol builds on established cryptographic techniques while adding innovations to improve security and regulatory compliance.</p>

<h2 id="how-this-changes-the-game"><strong>How This Changes the Game</strong></h2>

<p>Traditional privacy coins face a difficult choice: maintain privacy and face delistings or compromise privacy for compliance. SPARC represents a third path—maintaining essential privacy while enabling regulatory compliance.</p>

<p>This approach transforms privacy coins from theoretical privacy tools to practical financial instruments that can operate within regulated systems, while still preserving their core value proposition.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps"><strong>Next Steps</strong></h2>

Today, we’ll dive deeper into the specific challenges that privacy-focused cryptocurrencies face in today’s regulatory environment, particularly in Europe under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-coins-valuable-technology-under-pressure">Privacy Coins: Valuable Technology Under Pressure</h2>

<p>Privacy coins emerged as a response to one of cryptocurrency’s fundamental contradictions: blockchain transactions are pseudonymous, not anonymous. Without privacy enhancements, every transaction is permanently visible on public ledgers, creating significant concerns for personal and financial privacy.</p>

<p>Projects like Monero, Zcash, and Salvium address this by implementing cryptographic techniques that shield transaction details while maintaining the integrity of the blockchain. These innovations preserve the financial privacy that most of us take for granted in traditional banking—where our transactions aren’t publicly broadcast for anyone to analyze.</p>

<p>However, these same privacy features have made regulators concerned about potential misuse, leading to increasingly stringent oversight.</p>

<h2 id="the-european-regulatory-landscape">The European Regulatory Landscape</h2>

<p>The European Union’s MiCA framework represents the most comprehensive regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies to date. While MiCA doesn’t explicitly ban privacy coins, it creates conditions that make them extremely difficult to operate within regulated markets:</p>

<h3 id="the-central-exchange-cex-dilemma">The Central Exchange (CEX) Dilemma</h3>

<p>MiCA requires that crypto service providers, including exchanges, ensure all assets they list comply with specific transparency requirements. For privacy coins, this has led to a wave of delistings across European exchanges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Binance removed privacy coins like Monero and Zcash from platforms in France, Italy, Poland, and Spain</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kraken subsequently delisted these assets in Ireland and Belgium</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OKX and other major exchanges have followed similar patterns</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This trend has significantly reduced the accessibility of privacy coins for European users, pushing transactions to less regulated platforms or peer-to-peer exchanges.</p>

<h3 id="the-key-regulatory-requirements">The Key Regulatory Requirements</h3>

<p>Looking deeper, several specific MiCA provisions create conflicts with traditional privacy coin implementation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Travel Rule: Transactions over certain thresholds must include identifiable information about both sender and receiver</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AML and KYC Requirements: Service providers must track and report transactions to comply with anti-money laundering laws</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transparency Obligations: Detailed records of crypto activities must be maintained</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ban on Anonymous Features: Crypto assets with “built-in anonymization” must allow holders to be identified by crypto service providers</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>For most privacy coins, these requirements present a fundamental contradiction to their core design principles.</p>

<h2 id="the-privacy-paradox">The Privacy Paradox</h2>

<p>This brings us to what we call the “Privacy Paradox”—a situation where:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Users and businesses need financial privacy for legitimate purposes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Privacy technologies exist that can provide this protection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regulatory concerns about misuse limit access to these technologies through regulated channels</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, privacy becomes accessible only to those willing to operate outside regulated systems</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This paradox creates a significant divide between the potential benefits of privacy technology and its actual accessibility in daily life. It also means that legitimate businesses and individuals seeking financial privacy are unable to access compliant solutions.</p>

<h2 id="mica-doesnt-ban-privacyit-demands-accountability">MiCA Doesn’t Ban Privacy—It Demands Accountability</h2>

<p>A critical insight that guides Salvium’s approach is that MiCA doesn’t actually ban privacy. Rather, it demands accountability and mechanisms for identifying users when legally required. This distinction creates an opportunity for innovative solutions that can satisfy both needs:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Selective Disclosure: Enabling users to reveal transaction information to authorized parties without compromising global privacy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Return Functionality: Allowing two-way private transactions with accountability mechanisms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>View Access: Providing transparency options for compliance without exposing sensitive information to everyone</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-technical-challenges">The Technical Challenges</h2>

<p>Creating a system that satisfies both privacy and compliance requirements presents substantial technical challenges:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Cryptographic Complexity: Designing systems that can selectively reveal information while maintaining privacy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>User Experience: Making compliance mechanisms intuitive and minimally intrusive</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Security: Ensuring that compliance features don’t introduce new vulnerabilities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protocol Design: Creating future-proof systems that remain secure even as technologies like quantum computing advance</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To these technical challenges, we can add the need for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Scalability without compromising privacy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forward secrecy to protect past transactions even if keys are compromised</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protection against emerging threats and analytical techniques</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="beyond-regulation-user-experience-challenges">Beyond Regulation: User Experience Challenges</h2>

<p>While regulatory concerns often dominate discussions around privacy coins, they aren’t the only challenges these technologies face. Significant user experience issues have also limited adoption:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>One-Way Privacy: Most privacy coins excel at sending funds privately but struggle with return payments</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Refund Problems: Merchants cannot easily issue refunds without additional information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Limited Commercial Applications: Privacy features often come at the cost of functionality needed for everyday commerce</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Verification Difficulties: Proving payment history for accounting or tax purposes becomes complicated</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These practical limitations have restricted privacy coins to narrow use cases rather than enabling them to serve as comprehensive financial privacy solutions.</p>

<h2 id="the-opportunity-compliance-without-compromise">The Opportunity: Compliance Without Compromise</h2>

<p>The challenges facing privacy coins create a clear opportunity: developing technology that maintains essential privacy while meeting regulatory requirements. This goal—creating compliant privacy—is precisely what Salvium is working to achieve.</p>

<p>In our next post, we’ll explore how Salvium’s approach addresses these challenges through SPARC and other innovations, creating a pathway for privacy coins to operate within regulatory frameworks while preserving their essential functions.</p>

<p>The future of privacy coins depends not on resisting regulation, but on innovating within it—maintaining core privacy values while acknowledging legitimate oversight needs. This balanced approach is what will ultimately bring privacy technology into the mainstream, where its benefits can be widely accessible.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Education" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As privacy coins face increasing regulatory pressure, particularly under MiCA, we explore the challenges and opportunities in creating compliant privacy solutions.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://salvium.io/images/optimized/privacy-regulation.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://salvium.io/images/optimized/privacy-regulation.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">A Clear Path Forward</title><link href="https://salvium.io/blog/2025/04/07/a-path-forward/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Clear Path Forward" /><published>2025-04-07T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-07T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://salvium.io/blog/2025/04/07/a-path-forward</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://salvium.io/blog/2025/04/07/a-path-forward/"><![CDATA[<p>As we look back on the journey so far and ahead to what’s coming, it’s evident that Salvium has reached a pivotal moment. After weathering challenges and making significant technical breakthroughs, we have clarity on both our direction and purpose. This post marks the first in a series where we’ll explore the problems we’re solving, the innovative solutions we’re implementing, and our vision for the future of privacy in cryptocurrency.</p>

<h2 id="where-we-stand-today-salvium-zero">Where We Stand Today: Salvium Zero</h2>

<p>Our current implementation, Salvium Zero, has proven the core concepts that make our approach unique. As a proof of concept, it successfully demonstrated:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://docs.salvium.io/THE%20PROTOCOL/Asynchronous%20Transactions%20%28AT%29/">Asynchronous transactions</a></strong>: Enabling more complex operations like yield payouts</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://docs.salvium.io/THE%20PROTOCOL/Protocol_tx/">Protocol TX</a></strong>: A supplementary block-level transaction mechanism for minting new coins</li>
  <li><strong>Return address scheme</strong>: A mechanism allowing recipients to return funds to senders without knowing their address</li>
</ul>

<p>While these innovations set the groundwork for our vision, we recognized limitations in fully meeting regulatory requirements, particularly regarding anti-money laundering (AML) compliance and the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations.</p>

<h2 id="where-were-going-salvium-one">Where We’re Going: Salvium One</h2>

<p>Salvium One represents a significant evolution, taking the foundation of Salvium Zero and extending it to achieve full regulatory compliance without compromising privacy. The key innovation driving this advancement is <strong><a href="https://docs.salvium.io/THE%20PROJECT/sparc">SPARC</a></strong> (Spend Proof and Anonymized Returns for <a href="https://docs.salvium.io/THE%20PROJECT/carrot">CARROT</a>), which combines:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://docs.salvium.io/THE%20PROJECT/sparc/#anonymized-returns">Enhanced return payments</a></strong>: Maintaining privacy while enabling bidirectional transactions</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://docs.salvium.io/THE%20PROJECT/sparc/#spend-authority-proof">Spend authority proofs</a></strong>: Preventing potential money laundering by verifying wallet control</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://docs.salvium.io/THE%20PROJECT/carrot/#full-view-only-wallets">View-only wallet tier</a></strong>: Enabling compliant transaction history reporting without sharing private spend keys</li>
</ul>

<p>This combination of features uniquely positions Salvium among privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. While projects like Monero excel at privacy, they face increasing regulatory challenges and exchange delistings. Salvium’s approach creates a path for privacy coins to operate within regulatory frameworks while preserving their essential privacy features.</p>

<h2 id="the-road-ahead">The Road Ahead</h2>

<p>Our roadmap is ambitious but clear:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Salvium One</strong>: Implementing SPARC to achieve full MiCA compliance and enable CEX listings</li>
  <li><strong>Technical documentation</strong>: Releasing the Salvium One white paper</li>
  <li><strong>Salvium Two</strong>: Laying groundwork for private smart contracts and advancements in scalability</li>
</ol>

This audit became necessary after a security incident allowed unauthorized coin minting. For detailed information, please visit: <a href="https://salvium.io/salvium-knowledge-base/salvium-supply-audit/">Salvium Knowledge Base - Supply Audit</a>.</p>

<p>The audit has been thorough and extensive. We deeply appreciate the community’s support throughout this process. With the audit now finalized, we can fully redirect our focus to Salvium One development, accelerating the project into its next phase.</p>

<h3 id="audit-results-and-emission-impact">Audit Results and Emission Impact</h3>

<p>As anticipated, the audit confirmed that unauthorized coins were sold via exchanges. This resulted in approximately 9,459,087 SAL entering circulation ahead of schedule. These coins are now held by innocent purchasers who acquired them without knowledge of their origin.</p>

<p>Most importantly, we have verified that the unauthorized actor no longer possesses any valid coins from the incident. While they attempted to pass 382,600 coins through the audit, these were successfully blacklisted in a hard fork before the funds could be unlocked.</p>

<p>The premature circulation of these coins will not affect the initial maximum supply of 184.4 million SAL. Rather, it has accelerated our emission schedule, meaning the network will reach the planned total emission sooner than originally anticipated. For this reason, “inflation” is not precisely accurate—this represents an acceleration of planned emission rather than an increase to the total supply.</p>

<h3 id="governance-fund">Governance Fund</h3>

<p>The 10.4 million SAL from the governance vault that couldn’t be audited (due to being locked) remain in SAL, which is no longer usable. Upon the launch of Salvium One (anticipated in Q2 2025), we plan to implement a consensus-based mechanism to access these coins. Details of this mechanism will be provided at a later date.</p>

<p>The new SAL1 will continue to follow the locking schedule as defined in the lite paper. With the primary audit complete, we can confidently move forward with preparing a detailed treasury report. Despite the temporary inaccessibility of the locked 10.4 million SAL, the project maintains sufficient unlocked funds to fully implement all planned initiatives.</p>

<h3 id="mitigation-strategy">Mitigation Strategy</h3>

<p>The community has explored various strategies to address the accelerated emission, including burning a portion of the governance vault funds. However, given market volatility and uncertainty, it would be imprudent to burn governance funds at this stage, as we cannot precisely predict the capital required for the project’s path to self-sustainability.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that due to this accelerated emission event, the pre-mine now represents a smaller percentage of the overall circulating supply. All relevant documentation will be updated to reflect these changes.</p>

<p>We sincerely appreciate the community’s patience and continued trust as we implement these critical improvements to secure Salvium’s long-term integrity and sustainability.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Updates" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Important update on our recent audit completion and current supply status of Salvium.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://salvium.io/images/optimized/audit-complete.webp" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://salvium.io/images/optimized/audit-complete.webp" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Audit 0.8.0</title><link href="https://salvium.io/blog/2025/01/09/audit-080/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Audit 0.8.0" /><published>2025-01-09T16:05:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-09T16:05:00+00:00</updated><id>https://salvium.io/blog/2025/01/09/audit-080</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://salvium.io/blog/2025/01/09/audit-080/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-audit-has-started">The audit has started!</h1>

<p>Let’s get the bad news out of the way first. User-submitted transactions are temporarily disabled, but mining and existing yield accrual continues as normal, in preparation for the next phase of the audit.</p>

<p>Now the good news. Working with a world-renowned cryptographic consultancy company supporting us, we are taking a different approach to this audit compared to ideas that have been proposed for other Monero-based coins recently. There will be some short-term compromises on privacy, but we believe that the end result will justify the methods.</p>

<p>The audit will require everyone to perform a once-per-wallet “STAKE” transaction from the CLI wallet. (GUI wallet support for the audit process will possibly be added if the timescales permit.) This “STAKE” transaction will burn all the coins in the wallet, and record how many coins were found. The coins will then accrue yield (like a normal staking transaction in Salvium) for a period of 10 days (not the normal 30 days).</p>

<p>During those 10 days, the contents of the transaction will be analysed by both dedicated cryptographic software and by members of the team to look for anomalies. If nothing is found, then at the end of the 10 days the coins (including the earned yield) will be paid out, and you will be free to perform transactions with the new coins as normal.</p>

<p>If any anomalies are detected with the transaction, it will be flagged publicly, and the team will ask individuals to explain the anomaly privately to the team, before the coins are returned. If no individual comes forward to explain the anomaly, the coins will not be returned.</p>

<h2 id="current-status">Current status:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A hard fork v5 has been implemented at block height 136,100</li>
  <li>Wallets should be updated to v0.8.0. <a href="https://salvium.io/downloads/"><strong>CLI Binaries are available here</strong></a>. Desktop wallets will be available soon.</li>
  <li>All TRANSFER, STAKE, BURN, and RETURN_PAYMENT transactions are now disabled</li>
  <li>The chain continues to run and mining continues</li>
  <li>Yield payments on existing stakes will also continue to be processed normally</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-audit-process">The Audit Process</h2>

<p>To ensure the accuracy of the Salvium Supply figures, we will conduct a second fork as soon as possible that will enforce a comprehensive supply audit. This will be done using a modified version of the existing staking functionality. It will be updated so that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All SAL holders are required to participate in a compulsory staking process.</li>
  <li>A reduced 10-day lock period for audit stakes (reduced from 30 days)</li>
  <li>Audit functionality will be enabled - counting and monitoring staked coins.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="blocking-suspicious-transactions">Blocking suspicious transactions</h3>

<p>The steps in the audit process are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Users will submit a “stake” command from the CLI wallet (GUI wallet support will be added if possible during the audit process)</li>
  <li>The user’s wallet will then construct one or more STAKE transactions that will burn all of their coins using standard “protocol_tx” processes for a period of 10 days. The STAKE transaction(s) will contain special audit data, including:
    <ul>
      <li>The wallet public keys {Ks,Kv}</li>
      <li>Linkage data that proves each input being spent has come from the wallet with the specified public keys.</li>
      <li>Proof that the transaction does not provide any change - i.e. that all coins have been burnt</li>
      <li>The aggregated value in SAL of all of the inputs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The STAKE transaction(s) will be rejected if there is any discrepancy between wallet keys, or if any attempt is made to alter the amount of change being generated.</li>
  <li>The valid STAKE transaction(s) will be mined, and then are immutable on-chain, and verifiable by ANY OBSERVER - we are hoping that the community will help us be vigilant and spot potentially suspicious transactions (although we already have a dedicated scanning tool that flags everything we currently consider “suspicious”)</li>
  <li>If any transactions are flagged by the scanning tool, we will notify the community during the first 3 days after they enter the chain (through Discord and Telegram). If the team does not receive adequate proof of ownership for those coins within 4 subsequent days (i.e. within 7 days of submission) the transaction (and potentially also the wallet address) will be blacklisted. Blacklisted transactions will NOT pay out when the STAKE matures after 10 days.</li>
  <li>STAKE transactions that are not blacklisted will pay out in a new asset type “SAL1” upon maturing. SAL1 outputs will be spendable in all normal transaction types, and will be considered as audited.</li>
</ol>

<p>After approximately 30 days (21,600 blocks), the audit process will end. At that time, it will no longer be possible to submit SAL coins in any transaction - only SAL1 will be spendable in any way.</p>

<p>Mining block rewards from blocks after the start of the audit process will pay out in SAL1, not SAL - those coins will already be audited and will not need to be staked. Coins that have already been staked prior to the start of the audit process will be allowed to mature at the normal time, and will also pay out in SAL1, not SAL.</p>

<h2 id="exchange-status">Exchange Status</h2>

<p>All exchanges have been notified and will remain closed until the situation is fully resolved. We are in direct communication with exchange partners about the required steps for re-enabling trading.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Updates" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Details on the completion and findings of the Salvium v0.8.0 audit.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://salvium.io/images/optimized/audit-080.webp" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://salvium.io/images/optimized/audit-080.webp" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Understanding the Potential Inflation Vulnerability – Jan 2025</title><link href="https://salvium.io/blog/2025/01/06/potential-inflation-vulnerability/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Understanding the Potential Inflation Vulnerability – Jan 2025" /><published>2025-01-06T12:58:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-06T12:58:00+00:00</updated><id>https://salvium.io/blog/2025/01/06/potential-inflation-vulnerability</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://salvium.io/blog/2025/01/06/potential-inflation-vulnerability/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>We are now at the stage where we can share further details regarding the recent Salvium 0.7.x hard forks. We know that we have been slow in sharing this information, but it has been important for us to ensure its accuracy.</p>

<p>At the end of December, the core team initiated several hard forks to patch vulnerabilities that had been identified.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a missing ZK proof created a particular vulnerability that would allow a malicious actor to mint new coins in a way that would not be detected by the chain analysis script. This introduced the risk of a hidden inflation hack, which we are taking very seriously.</p>

<p>The custom chain analysis script that we developed was of no use in the case of this particular exploit.</p>

<p>This document sets out the nature of the vulnerability, along with the ZK proof that was deployed in v0.7.0 to prevent the risk of future exploitation. To ensure confidence in the protocol, we are currently planning an audit to confirm the exact supply.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-vulnerability">Overview of Vulnerability</h2>

<p>Salvium attempted to incorporate improvements over Monero, the coin on which Salvium was built. One such improvement was a “commitment to a difference,” rather than a “commitment to zero” as used by the Monero system. Monero’s “commitment to zero” approach meant that the commitment masks could not all be chosen independently. Implementing a “commitment to a difference” and providing that commitment in the transaction, allowed all commitment masks for all inputs and outputs in the transaction to be independent of one another.</p>

<p>The “difference commitment” is calculated when generating the input and output commitments as:</p>

<p><code>pr = Commit(sumPseudoOuts - sumOuts, 0)</code></p>

<p>However, in versions of Salvium before the 0.7.0 update, Salvium did not include proof that the “difference” commitment (denoted ) contained a zero “amount.” This resulted in the described vulnerability, which allowed for the potential creation of coins without leaving detectable evidence on the blockchain.</p>

<h2 id="the-missing-proof">The Missing Proof</h2>

<h3 id="the-required-proof">The Required Proof</h3>

<p>The required proof (that the difference commitment had no amount component, i.e., <code>p</code>) was a straightforward Schnorr-like sigma-protocol, as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generate a random scalar <code>b</code>.</li>
  <li>Compute <code>r = b · G + 0 · h</code>, where <code>G</code> is the generator point and <code>h</code> is the zero scalar.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="prover-steps-for-a-commitment-difference-d">Prover Steps (for a commitment difference d):</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Generates a random scalar <em>r</em> (a nonce).</li>
  <li>Generates a commitment to the scalar, i.e. <code>R = r · G</code>.</li>
  <li>Computes a commitment to the difference, with zero amount, i.e. <code>Cd = Commit(d, 0)</code>.</li>
  <li>Calculates a challenge <code>c = Hs(R || Cd)</code>.</li>
  <li>Calculates a response to the challenge <code>z = r + c · d</code>.</li>
  <li>Stores the tuple <code>{R, z}</code> and the commitment to the difference <code>Cd</code> in the transaction data.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="verifier-steps">Verifier Steps</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Recomputes the challenge from the proof and public data <code>c' = Hs(R || Cd)</code>.</li>
  <li>Recomputes the commitment to the scalar <code>R' = z · G - c · Cd</code>.</li>
  <li>Tests <code>R' ?= R</code> - if they are equal, then the commitment has a zero (0) amount term and is valid.</li>
</ol>

<p>By adding this proof in v0.7.0, Salvium has prevented any future exploitation of this vulnerability.</p>

<h2 id="audit-and-impact">Audit and Impact</h2>

<p>We must accept that the presence of a vulnerability means there is a risk that there has been an inflation hack. Given that Salvium is a private coin with an amount hiding, the only way to truly ascertain the circulating supply is to audit the coins. To that end, Salvium will undergo an audit to confirm the exact supply. For security, specific details of the audit won’t be shared at this stage.</p>

<h2 id="exchanges">Exchanges</h2>

<p>Exchanges were originally closed while we resolved the chain split. This issue has now been addressed, but it is prudent for exchanges to remain closed until the situation is clearer.</p>

<h2 id="acknowledgment-and-commitment">Acknowledgment and Commitment</h2>

<p>We acknowledge the disruption caused by the rapid implementation of hard forks and appreciate the community’s patience. Moving forward, our focus remains on transparency and security. Thank you for your understanding and trust as we navigate this crucial period.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Technology" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Technical analysis of the potential inflation vulnerability and our response.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://salvium.io/images/optimized/zx-vulnerability.webp" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://salvium.io/images/optimized/zx-vulnerability.webp" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Understanding Salvium’s v0.6 Series - Improved Difficulty Algorithm</title><link href="https://salvium.io/blog/2024/11/04/v06-series-update/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Understanding Salvium’s v0.6 Series - Improved Difficulty Algorithm" /><published>2024-11-04T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-11-04T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://salvium.io/blog/2024/11/04/v06-series-update</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://salvium.io/blog/2024/11/04/v06-series-update/"><![CDATA[<p>As we approach our upcoming network upgrade, we want to explain the journey of our v0.6 series and why these changes were made. Since releasing v0.6.0, community feedback and testing have led to several refinements, culminating in our latest release, v0.6.3.</p>

<h2 id="improved-difficulty-adjustments">Improved Difficulty Adjustments</h2>

<p>A key improvement in this upgrade is our transition to the Linearly Weighted Moving Average (LWMA) difficulty adjustment algorithm. While Salvium continues to use RandomX as its proven Proof of Work algorithm, LWMA changes how we adjust mining difficulty between blocks.</p>

<h4 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>More stable block times through better difficulty adjustments</li>
  <li>Improved response to hashrate fluctuations</li>
  <li>Better resistance against block timing manipulation</li>
  <li>More predictable and consistent block intervals</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-evolution-of-v06">The Evolution of v0.6</h2>

<p>Our journey to v0.6.3 has been driven by community feedback and real-world testing:</p>

<h4 id="v060-the-foundation">v0.6.0: The Foundation</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Introduced LWMA difficulty adjustments</li>
  <li>Implemented new consensus rules (HF1)</li>
  <li>Established base protocol improvements</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="v601-v602-refinement">v6.0.1-v6.0.2: Refinement</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Enhanced wallet performance</li>

  <li>Enhanced exchange integration capabilities</li>
  <li>Resolved return_payment function issues</li>
  <li>Final optimizations for upcoming Hard Fork 2</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="impact-for-different-users">Impact for Different Users</h2>

<h4 id="for-miners">For Miners</h4>

<p>While RandomX remains unchanged as our mining algorithm, the new difficulty adjustment system will provide more consistent block times and better handling of network hashrate changes. This means more predictable mining conditions for all participants.</p>

<h4 id="for-exchanges">For Exchanges</h4>

<p>The increased transaction input limit (now 120+) directly addresses feedback from exchanges, allowing for more efficient handling of withdrawals and better overall integration.</p>

<h4 id="for-regular-users">For Regular Users</h4>

<p>You’ll experience more reliable transactions, better wallet performance, and more consistent block times. The improvements in difficulty adjustments mean more predictable transaction confirmation times.</p>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>

<p>These updates fine-tune Salvium’s existing strengths. The improved difficulty adjustments, enhanced transaction capabilities, and overall stability improvements position us well for the upcoming Hard Fork 2 and beyond.</p>

These improvements reflect our commitment to building a robust, fair, and efficient privacy-focused blockchain. <em>The Salvium Core Team</em></h1>

<p>The v0.6 series brings significant improvements to Salvium’s difficulty adjustment algorithm, enhancing network stability and mining efficiency. This update represents a major step forward in our ongoing commitment to network optimization and security.</p>

<p>Our new difficulty algorithm introduces faster adjustment responses to hash rate changes, enhanced stability against time-warp attacks, and more precise difficulty targeting. These improvements ensure a more reliable and efficient mining experience for all participants.</p>

<p>The updated algorithm uses a rolling window of block times and implements weighted averaging that prioritizes recent blocks while considering historical data. We’ve also added guard rails to prevent extreme difficulty swings, making the network more stable and predictable.</p>

<p>These improvements translate into a more stable mining experience with better rewards distribution. Miners will see more consistent block times, improved profitability through predictable mining rewards, and reduced orphan rates thanks to better block time consistency.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Technology" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introducing key improvements in Salvium v0.6, featuring a new difficulty adjustment algorithm for better network stability.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://salvium.io/images/blog/difficulty-algo.webp" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://salvium.io/images/blog/difficulty-algo.webp" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
