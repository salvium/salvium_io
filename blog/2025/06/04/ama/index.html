<hr />

<p>In a recent flurry of updates, Salvium’s lead developer, SomeRandomCryptoGuy shared deep insights into the project’s roadmap, technical direction, and evolving goals. While it wasn’t an official AMA, the transparency and detail provided felt like one. We’ve distilled the highlights into a Q&amp;A format to give the community a clearer picture of where Salvium is headed—from foundational layers to the game-changing vision of Salvium Two.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: Can you walk us through the long-term vision for Salvium?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>A:</strong> Salvium started with a 2-year roadmap, split into three key stages:</p>

  <p>– <strong>Salvium Zero</strong> was our proof-of-concept. It introduced protocol-level asynchronous transactions, handling of transactional imbalances, return payments, and staking mechanics.</p>

  <p>– <strong>Salvium One</strong> focuses on delivering privacy with regulatory compliance. With frameworks like MiCA pushing privacy coins off exchanges, we saw a chance to differentiate by building compliant privacy into the protocol itself.</p>

  <p>– <strong>Salvium Two</strong> is where the real scalability happens. It’s intended as a full smart-contract platform—possibly DAG-based or something similar—focused on transaction throughput without being constrained by 2-minute block times. This layer-2 system shifts reconciliation back to layer-1, but rewards layer-1 validators with a cut of layer-2 gas fees.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: What makes Salvium Two different from other smart-contract platforms?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>A:</strong> Salvium Two will be designed as a transaction-oriented layer, rather than a block-oriented one. We’re not married to any one structure—DAG is a strong candidate—but the guiding principle is to eliminate block overhead and unlock scalability. We believe this model, when paired with our compliant privacy base, can be incredibly disruptive to both crypto and DeFi.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: How confident are you about reaching those goals within the two-year timeframe?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>A:</strong> We’ve funded the project so that even if anything happens to individual team members, the treasury will continue supporting ongoing development. That was built into the original 2-year plan. We’re not at the finish line yet, but we’re on track and as committed as ever. I’m still up at night researching quantum-secure proofs and building out the architectural design for Salvium Two. It’s that exciting.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: How are you handling the potential delay with FCMP++?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>A:</strong> That’s been one of the bigger uncertainties. With the recent delays, we’re now evaluating whether to build a full chain-membership proof scheme in-house. That wasn’t part of the original plan, but we’ve already started liaising with cryptographers to explore it. We’re staying flexible and ready to pivot if needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: What does the development team structure look like right now?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>A:</strong> It’s far from a one-person show. Devs like Akil have been making more commits than I have lately. We also have strong support from our partners at Cypher Stack. As we get closer to launch, you’ll see more of the broader team—including Community Managers, Marketing, and other support roles—stepping into the spotlight.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: What should the crypto world expect from Salvium One’s launch?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>A:</strong> When Salvium One launches, it’s going to send a clear message: privacy can coexist with compliance. That’s not just a tagline—it’s a reality we’re building. And Salvium is leading that charge.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: And what about Salvium Two? Any hints?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>A:</strong> Honestly, people have no idea what’s coming. Salvium Two will be a massively disruptive force across the entire crypto and DeFi ecosystem. We’re aiming to fundamentally reshape how people think about transaction processing and scalability.</p>
