                                    <p>For a comprehensive overview of Salvium, please visit our About page.</p>
                                </div>

                                    <h3>How does Salvium differ from other privacy coins like Monero?</h3>
                                    <p>While Salvium builds on Monero's privacy features, it distinguishes itself
                                        through its focus on DeFi capabilities and regulatory compliance. Salvium
                                        introduces staking, yield generation, and features designed to meet emerging
                                        crypto regulations while maintaining strong privacy protections.</p>

                                    <h3>Who is behind the Salvium project?</h3>
                                    <p>Salvium is developed by a team of experienced, anonymous experts in Monero,
                                        decentralized finance (DeFi), and applied cryptography. While the team members
                                        remain anonymous to maintain the project's decentralized nature, they bring a
                                        wealth of experience from pioneering work in implementing advanced cryptographic
                                        techniques for transaction privacy and security. The project began as a research
                                        initiative in early 2023 and has since evolved into a full-fledged blockchain
                                        platform.</p>

                                    <p>The initial supply of Salvium is 184.4 million SAL, with a tail emission of 3 SAL

                                    <p>Salvium uses the RandomX mining algorithm. Detailed mining instructions are
                                        available in our official documentation.</p>

                                    <p>Yes, Salvium had a 12.01% pre-mine. This pre-mine serves two main purposes:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Build (3.5%): Allocated as incentives for early developers and contributors
                                            to support the project's launch.</li>
                                        <li>Operations (8.48%): Set aside for ongoing development, enhancements, and new
                                            feature implementation. These tokens are time-locked and released over 24
                                            monthly installments.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The pre-mine is crucial for funding the project's development and ensuring its
                                        long-term sustainability.</p>

                                    <p>Exchange Mode is designed to help exchanges comply with MiCA regulations. It

                                        exact received funds, enabling exchanges to operate with Salvium while meeting

                                        receive 20% of the block reward, distributed proportionally among all active
                                        stakers based on their staked amount.</p>

                                        transactions, enabling more complex operations like yield payouts for staking.
